# School project on `Unity`

The goal of the project was to develop a game based on randomness. The game was supposed to generate characters with states (physical, health, etc.), and their appearance should be affected by these states. Additionally, a descriptive text should be generated based on these states as well as the other generated characters.

To achieve this, we used `ScriptableObjects` and the `Localization` package in Unity.
